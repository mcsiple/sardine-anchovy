# sardine-anchovy
Code for time series analysis of sardine and anchovy 

This code takes sardine and anchovy time series and calculates several metrics of synchrony/asynchrony, wherever possible. The time series are from Barange et al. (2009), the RAM legacy database, and FAO (for landings). The data from Barange et al. were extracted from the text in Checkley et al.'s "Climate Change and Small Pelagic Fish." The RAM legacy database data are the same as in Essington et al. (2015).
